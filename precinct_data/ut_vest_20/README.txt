## Processing Steps
The shapefile from the AGRC is of subprecincts, breaking down precincts in cases of district splits. In some cases, results are reported at the subprecinct level, in most cases, they weren't, so merging was done where necessary.
Emery County - 52 "canvas votes" were distributed to precincts.
